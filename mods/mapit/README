This mod displays a map of the entire minetest world with a location arrow and direction.
It also enables you to teleport with the world, either by dividing the world into a 10x10 grid, or if you install the travelpoints mod, it will place these on the map.
It can integrate with unified_Inventory, so you can access the map direct from the UI form.
Finally it also provides a map node with the world map on it, which can be placed like any other node.

Optional Dependancies:
Travelpoints - teleport links around the minetest world https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=8021

I've borrowed from other peoples code, so thanks to:
MAPP: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=4922.
VanessaE for her massive minetest colour file (I had to remove the comments as they broke the script), so maps show dramatically more features (and colours are more accurate).
Maps are generated offline by minetestmapper-numpy.py https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=8730. The legacy minetestmapper https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=49 is not supported as I recoded the -numpy script to add text comments to the PNG.
Not essential, but I also think MT-GitSync is great for keeping your mods uptodate https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=8749&hilit=gitsync

USAGE:
Install Dependancies:-
As well as enabling the mod in minetest you will need python, numpy, and the python imaging library. Very easy in Ubuntu: in the software centre, just install python, python-numpy and python-pil or python3, python3-numpy and python3-pil.

Generating map:
Normally, the map will be automatically generated when you enter a new world. Alternatively there is a button on the maptool to manually reMap (but you will have to exit the world and re-enter to update the texture).
It is possible to only regenerate at timed intervals (currently set up update each day, but you can set updateInterval in init.lua). However to enable this mode you'll need to install luaFileSystem. I'm not sure on Windows, but on linux it's:
sudo luarocks install luafilesystem
sudo apt-get install luarocks

Display the map:
Select the mapit:maptool in your inventory.
L-button (punch) to bring up the map.
So far it doesn't have a recipe, so you'll have to use creative mode, or the chat command: /give mapit:maptool

On the right of the form are buttons for zoom in/out (not working), reMap (as above), and teleport and travelpoints (if you have installed that mod).
With the teleport grid ground level is generally accurately identified. There used to be a bug meaning you might end up inside a node in which case if you teleport repeatedly to the same spot and as minetest loads blocks near your location, ultimately the surface will be reached (This doesn't seem to have occurred since a rewrite using voxelmanip).
With travelpoints, you can either click on the number location on the map (maximum of 50), or on the buttons on the right (max of approx 20 depending on form size).

TODO:
It probably won't be improved much from now, but the improvements I might (or wish I could) make are:-
*Zoom In and Out on the map - Would be great if it was possible to zoom in with the mousewheel, but looks like the formspec doesn't support that.
*Make a big mesh billboard...


Having said that, I think it is already quite a useful excellent quality map.
